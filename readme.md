# 👽 Coding Repo 🛸

Welcome to my code repo!
This repo servers as a kind of dumping ground for all of my code experiments across many languages as well as a store for old projects no longer in my professional repo.

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

🐍 Python – scripts, automation, and experiments

☕ Java – object-oriented adventures

🐧 Bash – shell scripts & Linux wizardry

⚙️  C – low-level power and performance

🤖 Ansible – playbooks for automation 

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into directories by language or tool.
Dive in to explore examples of my work, from beginner-friendly programs to more complex automation.

## 👾 Goals

Share my learning progress openly

Build a diverse coding portfolio

Have a place to archive all of my work 

## 🛸 Final Transmission

Feel free to explore, fork, and adapt anything you find useful.
If you run into any aliens along the way… don’t worry, they’re friendly 👽✨
